Heroes Of Pymoli Data Analysis

The population of players is most decidedly male with men making up 84% of the players counted.

The sweet spot in terms of age demographics is the 20-24 age group which makes up more than 44 percent of the players counted.

Oathbreaker is clearly the most popular game purchased and both in terms of numbers purchased and total revenue.
